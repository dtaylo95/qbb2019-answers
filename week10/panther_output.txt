The only gene that was significantly differentially expressed (in addition to being two-fold differentially expressed) was Adcy6. This gene was upregulated in the poly stage compared to the CFU stage.

Gene Ontology analysis with Panther against the genes with the most similar expression patterns (found in the "clustered_diff_exp_genes.txt" file) revealed a host of possible gene functions and pathways (see panther_output.png). The most represented pathways were involved in G protein signaling. Adcy6 itself encodes for an adenylyl cyclase, consistent with G protein signaling pathways. This may indicate increased signaling upon differentiation to later cell stages.
